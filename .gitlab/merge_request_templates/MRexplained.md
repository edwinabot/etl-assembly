### TL;DR
A one line description of what you fixed / created / destroyed

### Description (If TL;DR is more than one line)

_What:_ I created an evil piece of python code that meets this needs:
* Need A
* Need B
* Need C

_Why:_ Because we needed it for running this other stuff

_How:_ I used libraries A, B and C. First I do foo just because, then I created steps bar and baz for things 
and finally I push all data to an appropriate storage
